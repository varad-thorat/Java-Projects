When a program is run, the source code is first compiled into Java bytecode.
This compilation process is done by Java's compiler, which itself is a program.
Following that, the program gets executed, meaning the commands are executed 
one-by-one by a Java-interpreter that is able to read Java bytecode.

COMMENTS:

1}Single-line comments are marked with two slashes //. Everything following them on the same line is interpreted as a comment.
2}Multi-line comments are marked with a slash and an asterisk /*, and closed with an asterisk followed by a slash */.
 Everything between them is interpreted as a comment.

READING INPUTS:
For reading input, we use the Scanner tool that comes with Java. 
The tool can be imported for use in a program by adding the command import java.util.Scanner;
before the beginning of the main program's frame (public class ...).
The tool itself is created with Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);.


If one of the operands of the operation + is a string, the other operand will be changed into a string too during program execution. In the example below, the integer 2 is turned into the string "2", and a string has been appended to it.

The precedence introduced earlier also apply here:

System.out.println("Four: " + (2 + 2));
System.out.println("But! Twenty-two: " + 2 + 2);

Output: 

Four: 4
But! Twenty-two: 22


A method means a named set consisting of statements that can be called from elsewhere in the program code by its name.
Programming languages offer pre-made methods, but programmers can also write their own ones.
